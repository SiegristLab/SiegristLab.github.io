				<p class="index-description">How does a proteinâ€™s sequence encode its fold and function? How do changes in sequence influence disease risk, prognosis and treatment? How do gene expression patterns combine with protein activity to define cellular processes like growth, migration and communication? We develop new ways to probe the relationship between genotype and phenotype, enabling us to better answer these questions. To accomplish this goal, we draw on our expertise in genomics, protein science, technology development and computational approaches. </p>
